*** IMPORTANT

- Mojo::Server::FastCGI needs to work with more servers than Lighttpd.

- Mojo::Client needs some profiling and tuning.

- All the debug flags that output infos to STDERR need to be updated to use
  the logger.

*** IDEAS

- The ability to add more content handlers and filters besides
  Mojo::Content::Multipart and Mojo::Filter::Chunked might be interesting.
  (Would be a good sponsored project i guess)

*** THE USUAL STUFF THAT WILL BE ON THIS LIST FOREVER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE
    ENOUGH OF IT :)

- A lot of code needs to be cleaned.

- Tons of RFC spec tests need to be written.

- Documentation.
